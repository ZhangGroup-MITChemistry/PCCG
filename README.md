Potential Contrasting Coarse Graining
=====================================

Introduction
------------

`Potential contrasting <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00616>`_ is an efficient method for learning a potential energy function that can reproduce an ensemble of molecular conformations. It can be easily applied to can learn coarse-grained force fields based on all-atom simulations. It generalizes the `noise contrastive estimation method <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a>`_ to use complex unnormalized noise distributions constructed using molecular dynamics techniques such as `umbrella sampling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_sampling>`_.
