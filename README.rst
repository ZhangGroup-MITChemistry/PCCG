Potential Contrasting Coarse Graining
=====================================

Introduction
------------

`Potential contrasting <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10861>`_ is an efficient method for learning a potential energy function that can reproduce an ensemble of molecular conformations. It can be easily used to can learn coarse-grained force fields based on all-atom simulations. It generalizes the `noise contrastive esitmation method <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a>`_ to use complex unnormalized noise distributions that can be constructed using molecular dynamics techniques such as `umbrella sampling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_sampling>`_.
